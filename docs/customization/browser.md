The default browser is Firefox. But you can use any browser as your default browser.

As an example, let's install brave.

`yay -S brave-bin`

Then open the ML4W Dotfiles Settings app with SUPER+CTRL+S, open the waybar tab, scroll down and change the browser to brave.

`xdg-settings set default-web-browser brave.desktop`
