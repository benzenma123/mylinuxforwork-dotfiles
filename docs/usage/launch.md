## Launch Hyprland with sddm

The recommended way to launch the ML4W Dotfiles for Hyprland is with the Display Manager sddm.

The Dotfiles installation script will offer to install the display manager SDDM (https://github.com/sddm/sddm) + a configuration for the SDDM theme sdd-sugar-candy (https://github.com/Kangie/sddm-sugar-candy).

With the Hyprland settings script you can copy the current wallpaper into SDDM and use it as a background.

## Launch Hyprland from TTY

You can also start Hyprland from the command line with

```sh
# Start Hyprland
Hyprland
```

You can install a custom tty login issue (layout) with the Dotfiles installer or later with the ML4W Welcome App.

Please check the troubleshooting section in case of issues.
