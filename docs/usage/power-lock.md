Hypridle will start Hyprlock after 10 minutes of inactivity and will try to suspend one minutes later.

In the ML4W Dotfiles Settings App you can define the timeouts for Hyprlock, suspend and DPSM.

The selected hypridle configuration can be restored from the ML4W installer during a dotfiles update.
