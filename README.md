## Installation

The easiest way is to use the setup.sh script. The script will download all files from GitLab and start the installation.

```
bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/raw/dev/setup.sh)
```

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution and setup can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the installation will work everywhere. Installation on your own risk.
