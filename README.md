## Installation

The installation should work on all Arch Linux based distributions. [You can find more information here](hhttps://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/wiki).

The easiest way is to use the setup.sh script. The script will download all files from GitLab and start the installation automatically.

Just copy/enter the following command into your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/main/setup.sh)
```

The installer will ask you to select between:

- main release (Latest official release): [https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/releases/latest](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/releases/latest)
- rolling release (Development release): [https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles)

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. Installation at your own risk.
